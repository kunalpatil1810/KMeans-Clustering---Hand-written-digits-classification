This is a Machine Learning Project to classify hand written digits.
We have used K Means Algorithm for the classification.
Dataset is loaded using sklearn and code is in KMeans.py 
A code named Visual.py is attached to show how we can visualize the algorithm
thus visual.png depicts the MatplotLib Visualization.
